## About me

Hi, welcome to my portfolio. My name is Frieda Balduin, and I am a third-year psychology student at Maastricht University.
I am currently on an exchange at Dalhousie University, NS, putting the main emphasis of my studies on clinical neuroscience.
This portfolio displays my current Python skills and coding projects I acquired so far.
