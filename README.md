### About me

Hi, welcome to my portfolio. My name is Frieda Balduin, and I am a third-year psychology student at Maastricht University.
I am currently on exchange at Dalhousie University, NS, and the main emphasis of my studies is clinical neuroscience.
This portfolio displays my current coding projects and python skills I acquired so far.

### Main content

First, here is a Demo Video which I created in the beginning of the course "Neural Data Science",
in which I explain different strategies of [String formatting](String formatting video.webm).


#### 1) Coding with pandas DataFrames


#### 2) Visualization in Python

First, I learned working with matplotlib, and the differences between procedural and object-oriented plotting.
Using object-oriented plotting, I got to know how to generate sublots and modify such figures in specific ways.
Afterwards, seaborn was introduced. Here is an example of code for [plotting with seaborn](Github Portfolio.md) in python. 
(# comment : I know that it is not possible to see the graphs. I don't know why, that's something I still have to figure out).


#### 3) EDA


#### 4) Single-unit data


#### 5) EEG data
