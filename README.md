### About me

Hi, welcome to my portfolio. My name is Frieda Balduin, and I am a third-year psychology student at Maastricht University.
I am currently on exchange at Dalhousie University, NS, and the main emphasis of my studies is clinical neuroscience.
This portfolio displays my current coding projects and python skills I acquired so far.

### Main content

1. Coding with pandas DataFrames
2. Visualization in Python
3. EDA
4. Single-unit data
5. EEG data


First, here is a Demo Video which I created in the beginning of the course "Neural Data Science" at Dalhousie University,
in which I explain different strategies of [String formatting](String formatting video.webm).
