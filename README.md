### About me

Hi, welcome to my portfolio. My name is Frieda Balduin, and I am a third-year psychology student at Maastricht University.
I am currently on exchange at Dalhousie University, NS, and the main emphasis of my studies is clinical neuroscience.
This portfolio displays my current coding projects and python skills I acquired so far.

If you have any questions or remarks, don't hesitate to contact me via:
[fr361839@dal.ca](mailto:fr361839@dal.ca) or [frieda.balduin@web.de](mailto:frieda.balduin@web.de).


### Main content

First, here is a Demo Video which I created in the beginning of the course "Neural Data Science",
in which I explain different strategies of [String formatting](String formatting video.webm).


#### 1) Coding with pandas DataFrames

My python experience started with acquisition of knowledge about basic concepts like lists, dictionaries, for loops and conditionals. 
The integration of pandas DataFrames made coding a little more complex for the first time. 
Here is an example of my work with pandas DataFrames.


#### 2) Visualization in Python

First, I learned working with matplotlib, and the differences between procedural and object-oriented plotting.
Using object-oriented plotting, I got to know how to generate sublots and modify such figures in specific ways.
Afterwards, seaborn was introduced, for which I created this [example](Github Portfolio.md) in python. 
(# comment : I know that it is not possible to see the graphs. I don't know why, that's something I still have to figure out).


#### 3) Exploratory Data Analysis




#### 4) Single-unit data

Single-unit data is recorded from an individual neuron and describes therefore its firing patterns.
Such spike train activity can be illustrated by raster plots or peri-stimulus time histograms, as can be seen in this [example]().

Furthermore, it is also possible to work with data of multielectrode arrays.


#### 5) EEG data

EEG data is a continuos time series. It includes a spatial dimension, and its recorded activity varies constantly. 
The data can be viewed in a time or frequency domain.

A "subtype" are Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), small cutouts of activity bursts due to stimulation.
